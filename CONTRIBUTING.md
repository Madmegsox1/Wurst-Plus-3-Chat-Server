# Contributing Guide

For all contributions we will be looking for properly formatted code for 
example var names with Camel Casing
```java
//NOT TODO
int my_var_name = 0;
//TODO
int myVarName = 0;
```

Before you contribute you must test your code for bugs!

Please try to do small contributions so merging is easier!

Also join the discord to see the #todo section

Finally, please don't write china code!!!!!

Unless your me >:)
